Upon first glance, it’s no surprise why this is one of the most iconic album covers of all time, but I find it even more fascinating considering that it is despised by the designer. Paula Scher wished that this cover never saw the light of day. Although I just love this cover’s design, it taught me that design as a career is about compromise. That involves designing for others too, not just yourself. Just because the designer hated the design did not stop it from becoming one of the most recognizable covers in all of music. That opened me up to how design is about more than just personal taste.

  <h3 class="title">VERTIGO</h3>

        <p>From this poster I learned how simplistic design can truly be timeless. This poster was designed in the 1950’s yet would still hold a candle over most well designed movie posters today. It has inspired and served as influence to so many designers and projects. It taught me about color, how it impacts the mood of a piece, how less is more, how the strength of a font can impact its mood. So much can be learned from this poster, it represents an amazing film and stands as one of the most visually recognizable film posters ever made. </p>

        <p>This logo has defined streetwear and fashion for over 20 years now. It has taught me how simplistic a design can be, but still carry such a strong influence on society. What is just a single word typed out in italicised Futura set over a red box is now one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Yet the original designer, Barbara Kruger should be the original credit for the design, Supreme’s James Jebbia has taken her design and has turned it into an empire. Now designed in hundreds of colorways and patterns, what is simply text over a square is now a visual icon. This has taught me that not always the complicated route is the best route. Sometimes the dumbest design is the most impactful. </p>
